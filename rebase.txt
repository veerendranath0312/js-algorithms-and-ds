Re-basing: The Scariest Git Command❓

🚩 It’s actually very useful, as long as you know when NOT to use it

There are two main ways to use the `**git rebase**` command:

- as an alternative to merging
- as a cleanup

Rebasing❗

- We can instead rebase the feature branch onto the master branch.
- This moves the entire feature branch so that it BEGINS at the tip of the master branch
- All of the work is still there, but we have re-written history
- Instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by creating new commits for each of the original feature branch commits

```
$ git switch feature
$ git rebase master
```

- If the master branch is very active then your feature branch’s history is muddied
- Now when your work is done and when you push your changes back into master there will be a lot of unnecessary merges commits in the master branch

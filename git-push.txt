## Pushing

- To push the local code to GitHub, we need to use the git push command
- We need to specify the remote we want to push up to AND the specific local branch we want to push up to that remote

# To push the code
$ git push <remote> <branch>

# Example
$ git push origin master


- git push origin master tells git push up the master branch to our origin remote
